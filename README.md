I recently completed the "Analyzing International Debt Statistics" project on DataCamp, which provided me with a valuable opportunity to apply my SQL skills in a real-world context. Throughout the project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset of international debt statistics, allowing me to gain insights into global financial trends and patterns. By leveraging SQL querying techniques, I was able to extract relevant information, perform data analysis, and uncover key findings related to debt accumulation across different countries. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my SQL proficiency but also deepened my understanding of financial dynamics on a global scale.
Throughout the project, you will address a series of challenging questions, such as:

Which countries have the highest external debt?
What is the trend in debt accumulation over the years?
How does debt compare between different regions?
Which countries have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio?
What are the major contributors to debt accumulation?
